                <h2>Project 1: : Garbage Monitoring System  </h2>
                <p>Description: The Garbage Monitoring System combines an HC-05 Bluetooth module and an ultrasonic sensor to measure garbage levels. As the garbage fills up, the sensor detects the change in distance and sends this data wirelessly to the Blynk cloud. Users can then easily track and manage garbage levels in real-time through the Blynk app or web interface, streamlining waste management.

                <h2>Project 3:Cyber Security Threat Detector</h2>
                <p>Description: In the evolving landscape of cybersecurity, swift and accurate threat detection is
                    critical. This project presents a Java-based application designed to enhance
                    cybersecurity through advanced threat detection. Leveraging network data, the
                    application uses descriptive and inferential statistical methods alongside data
                    science techniques to monitor and predict potential threats.
                    The development of this Java-based cybersecurity threat
                    detector aims to advance proactive cybersecurity measures, contributing to a safer
                    digital environment.</p>
